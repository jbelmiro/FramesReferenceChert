Variable,Allowed values,Description
Raw Material Type,-,Type of raw material.
Color Distribution,"Single, Mix sharp, Mix diffuse.",Distribution of color on the sample’s surface. Single - the color is uniformly distributed across the surface; Mix sharp - there is color variability with a sharp contact between colors; Mix diffuse - the color has differences across the surface without a sharp contact.
Munsell Color,-,Colors according to the Munsell Soil Color Chart. All color variability on the sample's surface is registered.
Luster,"Shiny, Medium, Dull.",The character of light reflected by minerals. Shiny refers to when the piece has a very intense luster; Medium refers to when the piece has some luster but it is not very intense; Dull refers to when the piece has no luster. According to Crandell (2006) and Luedtke (1992).
Translucency,"Translucent, Sub-translucent, Opaque.",Degree to which the light can penetrate a material when held 5cm from a 40w lamp. Translucent - silhouettes can be seen through the sample's thin part and/or light passes through the thick parts; Sub-translucent - light only passes through the thin parts; Opaque - no or almost no light passes through. According to Bressy (2002) and Crandell (2006).
Feel,"Smooth, Semi-smooth, Rough.",A fingernail is dragged across the sample's surface. Smooth - nothing can be felt; Semi-smooth - slight rough feel; Rough - if the sample is distinctly rough. According to Bressy (2002) and Crandell (2006).
Grain,"Coarse, Medium, Fine.","The size of the grain is observed macroscopically and classified. These classifications can be then compared to the microscopic classification (in brackets). Coarse - large, noticeable grains and individual particles can easily be discerned (macrocryptocrystaline); Medium - small but still noticeable grain (macrocryptocrystaline); Fine - no noticeable grain (micro-cryptocrystaline). According to Bressy (2002) and Crandell (2006)."
Distribution,"Even, Uneven.","Refers to the distribution of grain, luster, and transparency. Even - grain, luster, and transparency are homogeneous across the sample; Uneven - grain, luster, and transparency are heterogeneous across the piece. According to Luedtke (1992)."
Distribution type,"Gradual, Abrupt.","The transition of the distribution of grain, luster, and transparency. Gradual - the transition between different characteristics is gradual; Abrupt - the transition between different characteristics is abrupt."
Pattern,"Shaded, Spots, Lines, Mix, Other, None.",Type of pattern present on the sample. According to Crandell (2006).
Spots type,"Spotted, Splotched, Broad mottling, Marbled mottling, Speckling, Flecks.","Can be described based on the size and regularity. Spotted - circle patterns less than 30% of the surface area; Splotched - irregular shapes less than 30% of the surface area; Broad mottling - large, irregular blotching, covering more than 30% of the surface; Marbled mottling - large relatively round shapes, covering more than 30% of the surface; Speckling - small dots, well distributed over the surface; Flecks - small dots, grouped together. According to Crandell (2006)."
Spots distribution,"Even, Uneven.",Distribution of spots on the surface. They may be even if they are evenly distributed or uneven if they are irregularly spread throughout the surface (grouped). According to Crandell (2006).
Spots percentage,"1-49%, 50-99%, 100%.",Percentage of the sample occupied by spots on the sample's surface.
Lines type,"Banded, Streaked, Laminated, Finely laminated.",Thickness of line present on the sample. Banded - regular lines greater than 10mm thick; Streaked - less regular form of banding; Laminated - lines with thickness less then 10mm; Finely laminated - series of lines less than 1mm. According to Crandell (2006).
Lines direction,"Horizontal, Concentric.",Orientation of lines. Can be horizontal or concentric circles originating from a central point. According to Crandell (2006).
Lines percentage,"1-49%, 50-99%, 100%.",Percentage of the sample occupied by lines on the sample's surface.
Cortex presence,"Yes, No.",Presence of cortex on the pieces.
Cortex type,"Outcrop, Pebble, Unknown.","Type of cortex. Outcrop refers to a cortex from an outcrop; Pebble refers to a rounded, smooth cortex."
Cortex transition,"Sharp, Gradual.",Type of transition between cortex and interior. Sharp if the transition is sharp and obvious; Gradul refers to a transition which is blurred and prolonged. According to Crandell (2006).
Cortex nature,"No reaction, Weak reaction, Strong reaction.","A drop of HCL (10%) is placed on the cortex present in the sample and the chemical reaction is described. No reaction - the drop of acid produces no reaction on the sample; Weak reaction - the drop bubbles slightly and produces some vapor; Strong reaction - the drop bubbles intensely, producing vapor and audible sound."
Inclusions presence,"Yes, No.",Presence of inclusions.
Inclusions type,-,Description and classification of inclusions.
Fracture type,"Conchoidal, Uneven, Other, Unknown.","Type of fracture on the rock. Conchoidal - Conchoidal fracture as described by Luedtke (1992); Uneven - Uneven, non-conchoidal fracture; Other - Other types of non-conchoidal fracture; Unknown - When the character of the fracture cannot be identified."
Surface homogeneity,"Homogeneous, Fractures, Cleavage plains.","The homogeneity of the sample's surface, specifically the presence or absence of fractures or cleavage plains. Homogeneous - No visible fractures on the sample; Fractures - The sample has visible natural fractures; Cleavage plains - The existence of a visible crystallographic plane where the sample cleaves through."
Quality,"Good, Acceptable, Low.","Knapping quality of the raw material. Good - Fine grain, conchoidal fracture and homogeneous surface; Medium - Fine grain, non-conchoidal fracture, and/or presence of fractures or cleavage plains; Low - Coarse or medium grain, non-conchoidal fracture, and/or presence of fractures or cleavage plains."
