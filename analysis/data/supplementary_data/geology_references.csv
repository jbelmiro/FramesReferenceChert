Lower Jurassic,Carixian,Dolomitic limestone with chert nodules from Praia do Belixe (J1e),"Chert nodules and beds can be found in the stratigraphy in the following layers: CSV.2 - alternating layers of dolomitic limestones with chert nodules and marly limestone; CSV.5- yellow marly limestone with crinoids and abundant rounded chert nodules; CVS.6 – White limestone, with frequent crinoids and chert nodules; BEL.2 – Alternating layers of white limestone in small beds with marly limestone, with abundant chert nodules of several colors (pink, red, black); BEL.5 – Dolomitic limestone with abundant rounded chert nodules; BEL.7 – Crystalline limestone with grey patina, with rare chert nodules and abundant brachiopod and lamellibranch fossils.",Notícia explicativa da Folha 51-B pp.18-22; Notícia explicativa da Folha 52-A pp. 16; Ribeiro 2005; Rocha 1976
Lower Jurassic,Sinemurian-Toarcian,Limestones with Paleodasucladus and limestones with chert nodules (J1),"The stratigraphy is composed of micritic limestones, with rare reefal deposits, followed by thick oolitic limestone layers. At the base of the reefal deposits chert micronodules were identified.",Notícia explicativa da Carta Geológica 8 pp.53
Middle Jurassic,Aalenian-Bajocian,Limestones with chert nodules (J2a) - Malhão formation,"The Malhão formation is carbonated, marine and relatively thick. The stratigraphy is composed by a succession of layers of oolitic limestones, grey micritic limestones and clastic limestones. Above there are monogenic conglomerates with micritic limestone intercalations with chert beds and nodules. The siliceous nodules may have sponge spicules and radiolarians. At Guilhim, chert can also be found in microcrystalline limestones with chert nodules (pel-biomicrite) with silicified malacofauna and silicified corals.",Notícia explicativa da Carta Geológica 8 pp.54; Notícia explicativa da Folha 53-B pp. 8; Notícia explicativa da Folha 53-A pp. 10; Notícia explicativa da Folha 52-B pp. 7
Middle Jurassic,Bajocian-Batonian,Alagoa conglomerates,"This is a conglomerate unit, monogenic and carbonated, where a few clasts were observed and attributed to the Batonian (partially dolomitic limestones with chert nodules).","Notícia explicativa da Carta Geológica 8, pp. 55"
Upper Jurassic,Kimmeridgian/Portlandian/Upper Oxfordian,Limestones with chert nodules from Jordana (J3)/(J3J0)/(J3-4a) = Limestones with silicified fossils and chert nodules (J3-4a),"Jordana limestones are somewhat clayish, dark grey, in medium banks, with frequent secondary and irregular silicifications. These silicifications are dark brown (due to alterations) and have abundant fossil fragments: sponges, corals, echinoderms, lamelibranchs. These are compact limestones, dark grey, with local, abundant, and irregular silicifications of diagenic origin, but with abundant silicified fossil fragments like corals, crinoids, bivalves, sponges, diverse microfossils and rare ammonites. They contain frequently silicified fossil fragments (corals, crinoids and bivalves). They have an essentially pelagic component. The extremely pelagic levels are of pelmicrites with dominant spicules, small fragments of pelagic echinoderms, isolated and small _Tubiphytes_, accompanied by a reduced number of epistomines and foraminifers (_Reophax_ sp., _Textularia_ sp., _Lenticulina_ sp.). The exogenous material is composed of many organism fragments: stromatolithichs, sponges, corals, brachiopods, serpulids, bivalves, _Tartharella_ sp., _Macroporella pygmae_, among others. The bioclasts are often silicified.","Notícia explicativa da Carta Geológica 8, pp.57; Notícia explicativa da Folha 53-A, pp.16; Notícia explicativa da Folha 52-B, pp. 9; Notícia explicativa da Folha 53-B, pp.13; Marques 1983; Marques 1985, pp. 37; Ramalho 1985, pp.43-44"
